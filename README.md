Introduction:

Data analysis is important in business to understand problems facing an organization, and to explore data in meaningful ways. Data in itself is merely facts and figures. To know how to analyze data is an important skill to learn nowadays. It answers many questions that tends to get raise in future. So, it is a big help to know the answers already and for that data should be analyzed thoroughly. This project is meant to be a good practice of doing data analysis.
