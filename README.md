Introduction:

Data analysis is important in business to understand problems facing an organization, and to explore data in meaningful ways. Data in itself is merely facts and figures. To know how to analyze data is an important skill to learn nowadays. It answers many questions that tends to get raise in future. So, it is a big help to know the answers already and for that data should be analyzed thoroughly. This project is meant to be a good practice of doing data analysis.

The dataset on which I worked, consists of data about IPL matches played from the year 2008 to 2019. IPL is a professional Twenty-Twenty cricket league founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2008. The league has 8 teams representing 8 different Indian cities or states. It enjoys tremendous popularity and the brand value of the IPL in 2019 was estimated to be â‚¹475 billion (US$6.7 billion).
